          <h1>Hedera</h1>
          <p>A Hadoop toolkit for processing large versioned document collections</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Some technical features:</h1>
      </div>
      
    <p>
    While there are several frameworks built to support
processing big textual data (both in MapReduce and non-MapReduce
fashion), little has been focused on efficient processing of versioned
document collections such as Web archives, revisions of collaborated
documents (news articles or encyclopedia pages such as Wikipedia). As
compared to traditional corpora, versioned documents have some following
special characteristics: 
    </p>

<ul>
 <li>Two-level Load Balancing*: As a typical Hadoop setting, Hedera
  feeds the Mapper with InputSplits. Each InputSplit object contain a
  self-described piece of text and will be processed in
  parallel. The sizes of the InputSplit is calculated based on the
  size of the documents, snapshots and system-defined max split size. Hedera splits versioned documents via two levels:
   <ul>
      <li>
	Level 1: Each InputSplit contains a set of full snapshots of
      documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Level 2: Each InputSplit is read using an ETLReader
      implementation to output several Mapper input. Each Mapper input
      contains document header, a set of related snapshots or their
      differentials, depending on one particular job. Here the
      "relatedness'' is defined using a factory of Hedera methods, and
      is extensible to faciliate new processing requirements.
      </li>
   </ul>
 </li>
	  
 <li>Incremental Processing*: When used for indexing or information
   extraction jobs, Hedera provides the option to work with 
   differentials instead of many duplicated texts. A Hedera reader
   checks for two snapshots and outputs only their changes to the next
   step of the workflow. This helps reducing a huge amount of text
   sent around the network, and in many cases it is sufficient to
   look only the changes in the job. When original text is needed, a
   Reconstructor can be called to communicate with related objects
   (via the ids stored in the header of the messages), and it 
   re-builds the content in reducer phase at will.</li>

 <li>Fast Approximated Reader and Extractor on the go*: In many cases,
   versions of one documents can differ
   by only a few minor tokens, and those differences are irrelevant
   for many information extraction jobs. Hedera provides a fast way to
   skip redundant snapshots and only triggers the extraction when
   detecting the big changes in semantics of the documents. A typical
   workflow for a fast reading and extraction is as follows:
   <ul>
    <li>
   An ETLReader object is implemented and instantiated. The reader
     is pushed down to the very first phase of the inputting cycle in
     Hadoop, thereby to avoid passing irrelevant text to the next
     layer.
    </li>
    <li>
     It extracts lightweight meta-data for each snapshots it reads
     (e.g. snapshot length, the length of title, timestamps,...). This
     is done by overwritting the method <code>extractMetadata()</code>
     in ETLReader.
    </li>
    <li>
     For each new snapshot obtained, the reader examines its meta-data
     with ones from previous snapshots.
    </li>
    <li>
     If a substantial change is detected, the previous snapshot is
     thrown away and replaced by the new one.
    </li>
    <li>
     If there are no big changes in the content, the reader then
     invokes the method <code>inspectEdits()</code> to see whether the
     currently visited snapshots is  the improvement of syntax,
     typos, etc. of the previous one and can replace it. Note that both methods
     <code>extractMetadata()</code>
	  and <code>inspectEdits()</code> work only on the meta-data of
     the snapshots and not the actual contents. They are based on
     heuristics to enable fast checking.
    </li>
    <li>
     After these two fast checking, the actual (and often expensive)
     information extraction operation is called. After that, all
     previous snapshots are thrown away.
    </li>
   </ul>
 </li>


 <li>Compressed file handling: Many big corpora bundles the documents
   in one or several compressed file chunks. Hedera supports the
   ability to detect snapshots and splits virtually the document
   snapshots inside each chunk, without performing physical
   decompression on the files. The decompressing and reading is
   deferred till the last phase of the information extraction.
 </li>
</ul>
