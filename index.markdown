# About Me
I am a senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/), with experience in different areas of Natural Language Processing, Autonomous Driving, Knowledge Graphs, and Field Data. 

Prior to Meta, I worked for [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com/) from 2017 to 2023 in different research and development projects in the areas of autonomous driving, digitalization, and quality management. During that time, I took many technical and non-technical roles: AI engineer, product owner, software architect, workstream leader (a title for someone who leads a sub-project), and (applied) ML scientist. My last role there was senior expert (German: _fachreferent_) in data science projects for quality management. At Bosch, I also supervised and co-supervised 5 Master students and 1 PhD student, all in the topic of Machine Learning in Automobile domain. 

Before joining industry, I pursued my PhD at the [L3S lab](https://www.l3s.de/de), under the supervision of Prof. [Wolfgang Nejdl](https://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/). I hold a doctoral degree (_Dr.rer.nat_) in Computer Science from the [Leibniz University of Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/) (_magna cum laude_); my topic was about temporal text mining on social media analysis and digital preservation using graph-based methods. During my PhD study, I worked in different publicly funded research projects (EU FP7 and DFG) as a researcher and developer. 

In 2016, I visited [IBM Research Ireland](https://research.ibm.com/labs/ireland) and participated in the project [Debater](https://research.ibm.com/interactive/project-debater/), contributing to developing an informattion extraction method for decision gisting from meeting dialogues.

I hold a Master degree in Computer Science from [Max-Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de) under the supervision of Prof. [Gerhard Weikum](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/%7Eweikum/). My Master thesis was about rendering timeline for an entity at scale using knowledge graphs and parallel processing.

### Private

I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam; and now I live in a small town in the southern of Germany with my wife and two litte girls (Vy and Lea). Before the parenthood, I loved travelling and jogging, and country music.
